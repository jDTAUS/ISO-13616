/**

 * International Bank Account Number.
 * <p>The IBAN structure is defined in ISO 13616-1 and consists of a two-letter ISO 3166-1 country code, followed by two
 * check digits and up to thirty alphanumeric characters for a BBAN (Basic Bank Account Number) which has a fixed length
 * per country and, included within it, a bank identifier with a fixed position and a fixed length per country. The
 * check digits are calculated based on the scheme defined in ISO/IEC 7064 (MOD97-10). The Society for Worldwide
 * Interbank Financial Telecommunication SCRL, SWIFT, has been designated by the ISO Technical Management Board to act
 * as the Registration Authority for ISO 13616. Nationally-agreed, ISO 13616-compliant IBAN formats are submitted to the
 * registration authority exclusively by the National Standards Body or the National Central Bank of the country. For
 * further information see the <a href="../../../doc-files/IBAN-Registry_Release-78-August-2017.pdf">IBAN REGISTRY</a>.
